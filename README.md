This is the repository that I stored all of my programming assignment for the course 02-201 Programming for Scientists.

Most of the programming implementation are in the Go language, including numerial algorithms, autometa simulation and Object Oriented Programming in Go.

cellularautomata: A program that simulate Cellular automata behaviors.

drawing: A programming practice with draw2d package.

folding: A program that simulate Protein Folding.

functions: Write some basic functions in Go.

goldbach: Write some basic functions in Python.

hw8: Using assembly language to implement a random number generater.

markvshaney: Simulating an English speaker with Mark V Shaney pattern

randomwalk: A random walk implementaion in Go

sandpile: Using Go to simulate sandpile senario

spatial: Simulate a spatial game with Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma theory.

Please don't copy any part of my code for your assignments in CMU. You will get caught.
